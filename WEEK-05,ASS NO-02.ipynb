    "In Python, the **Exception** class is the base class for all exceptions. When creating a custom exception, it is essential to inherit from the **Exception** class (or any of its subclasses) for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Consistency with the Exception Handling Framework**\n",
    "   Python's exception-handling mechanism (i.e., the `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks) is designed to catch objects that are derived from the **BaseException** class (with **Exception** being a more specific subclass used in most cases). By inheriting from **Exception**, you ensure that your custom exception behaves like other built-in exceptions and can be caught using `except` blocks in a predictable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Access to Standard Exception Functionality**\n",
    "   The **Exception** class provides basic functionalities, such as storing error messages, stack traces, and error codes. By subclassing **Exception**, your custom exception inherits these features, making it easier to customize the behavior (e.g., adding a custom message or additional attributes) while preserving the standard exception mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Code Readability and Maintainability**\n",
    "   Using the **Exception** class as the base for custom exceptions makes your code more readable. It signals to other developers that your class represents an exception, which will be used in error-handling scenarios. This also helps others understand how and where the custom exception might be raised and caught.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Interoperability with Other Exception Types**\n",
    "   When custom exceptions inherit from **Exception**, they work seamlessly with any code that expects exceptions. This includes third-party libraries and Python's own exception-handling code, which typically handles objects that derive from **Exception**. If your custom exception did not inherit from **Exception**, it might not be caught or handled correctly in standard `except` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",

    "1. **`FloatingPointError`**\n",
    "2. **`OverflowError`**\n",
    "3. **`ZeroDivisionError`**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`FloatingPointError`**\n",
    "   **`FloatingPointError`** is raised when a floating-point operation fails. However, this error is not commonly raised in modern Python code because Python's floating-point arithmetic is designed to handle a wide range of operations without raising an exception (e.g., it returns `inf` for division by zero in floating-point division).\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "   **`OverflowError`** is raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be expressed within the available range for the numeric type. In Python, this usually happens with integer or floating-point operations, though Python's integers can grow arbitrarily large, so this error is more common with floating-point operations or in older versions of Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. **`ZeroDivisionError`**\n",
    "   **`ZeroDivisionError`** is raised when a division or modulo operation is performed with zero as the divisor. This is one of the most common arithmetic errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Example:\n",

    "   **`ModuleNotFoundError`** is a subclass of **`ImportError`** that was introduced in Python 3.6. It is specifically raised when a module cannot be found during the import process. While **`ImportError`** can be used more generally (for example, if a module is found but fails to import due to some other issue), **`ModuleNotFoundError`** strictly indicates that the module itself cannot be found.\n",

    "### Key Differences Between `ImportError` and `ModuleNotFoundError`\n",
    "1. **Specificity**:\n",
    "   - **`ModuleNotFoundError`** specifically indicates that the module was not found.\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Effective exception handling is crucial for building robust and maintainable Python applications. Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Use Specific Exceptions**\n",
    "   - Always catch specific exceptions instead of using a bare `except:` clause or catching `Exception` or `BaseException`. This prevents unintended catching of exceptions that you may not want to handle.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "   except ValueError:\n",
    "       # Handle specific ValueError\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Use Multiple Except Clauses**\n",
    "   - If you need to handle different exceptions differently, use multiple `except` clauses to provide tailored handling for each exception type.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise exceptions\n",
    "   except ValueError:\n",
    "       # Handle ValueError\n",
    "   except KeyError:\n",
    "       # Handle KeyError\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Avoid Catching Unnecessary Exceptions**\n",
    "   - Don't catch exceptions that you cannot handle. If you cannot deal with a specific exception, let it propagate up the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Use Finally for Cleanup**\n",
    "   - Use the `finally` block to ensure that cleanup actions (like closing files, releasing resources, or rolling back transactions) are always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Cleanup code\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Log Exceptions**\n",
    "   - Log exceptions for debugging and auditing purposes. Use the `logging` module to record the exception details, which can help you diagnose issues later.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       logging.error(\"An error occurred: %s\", e)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Provide User-Friendly Messages**\n",
    "   - When raising exceptions or handling them, ensure that error messages are clear and helpful to the user. Avoid technical jargon when possible.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "   except ValueError:\n",
    "       print(\"Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Use Custom Exceptions for Application-Specific Errors**\n",
    "   - Create custom exception classes to handle application-specific errors. This makes your code more readable and easier to manage.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       raise MyCustomError(\"This is a custom error message.\")\n",
    "   except MyCustomError as e:\n",
    "       print(e)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Handle Exceptions at the Right Level**\n",
    "   - Handle exceptions at the level where you can best respond to them. If an exception can be handled locally, do so. If it requires higher-level handling, allow it to propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Be Careful with Silent Failures**\n",
    "   - Avoid catching exceptions without handling them or logging them, as this can lead to silent failures, making it difficult to diagnose issues later.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "   except ValueError:\n",
    "       pass  # Silent failure (not recommended)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Consider Using Context Managers**\n",
    "   - For resource management (like file handling), use context managers (`with` statement) to automatically handle setup and teardown, reducing the need for explicit exception handling.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('file.txt') as f:\n",
    "       # Read or write file\n",
    "   ```\n",
